# Gerador de Senhas (Password Generator)

An easy-to-remember password generator (like the one from [1Password](https://1password.com/pt/password-generator/)) that uses Brazilian Portuguese words.

The idea for this project came from the lack of a password generator that uses words from my native language. So I decided to build one using common words from our Brazilian Portuguese.

You can choose the number of words to include in the generated password and it will concatenate them with a special character in between. This allows creating strong and easy to remember
passwords without sacrificing security.

Thank you https://www.dicio.com.br/ for many of the words used here. Although I am planning on removing them. ðŸ‘€
